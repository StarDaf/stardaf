Someone asked for password reset for email {{ email }}. Follow the link
below:

{{ protocol }} :://{{ domain }}{% url 'account:password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

Your username, in case you've forgotten: {{ user.get_username }} 

If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL
in a new browser window instead.

If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered
your email address by mistake while trying to reset a password. If you didn't
initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action and can safely
disregard this email.

Thanks,

Team StarDaf.
